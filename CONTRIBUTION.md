# How to Contribute to Kairy?

### Requirements:

- Currently, the development server runs only on NodeJS version 14 so make sure you have NodeJS version 14 installed on your machine. You can install different versions of NodeJS with Node Version Manager. (Check out: [How to install nvm](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/)).

* VS Code IDE with ESLint and Prettier setup is preferred.

### Steps to set kairy locally for development:

- `git clone https://github.com/prajjwalkapoor/kairy`
- `cd kairy`
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev:chrome`

Note: _Make sure you have node version 14_

After this, go to any chromium-based browser, open developer mode in the extensions tab, and import the folder by clicking on unpack extension from `extension/chrome`.
